    - how

    - The Password Generator website is designed to quickly and easily generate passwords for users.

    - It allows users to input criteria for said passwords so that they generate with parameters suiting to the user's needs.

    - The website was created using HTML and CSS formatting to provide ease-of-use and quick access, with Javascript to allow for dynamic options and usability.

    --- As per the assignment:

    -- The HTML and CSS code was given beforehand and remains unaltered.

    - The Javascript code was created from scratch to manipulate text within the HTML to generate a password.

    -This was done using Javascript elements such as variables, arrays, if statements, for loops, Math.floor/Math.random (random number generation), array methods, functions, and querySelectors.

    --The website allows for the generation of a password between 8 and 128 characters long with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

    - Amongst the four options (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters), each requires verification by the user or else will be excluded from the generation of the password.
